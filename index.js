    "text": "Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., pushed back Tuesday on the defenses being offered by the White House and Republicans for President Trump\'s phone call with the president of Ukraine, which has prompted an impeachment inquiry that will move to public hearings this week.\n\nKildee responded to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway saying earlier on \"America\'s Newsroom\" that Democrats want to overturn the results of the 2016 election through impeachment and do not want to run against Trump next year.\n\nA memo circulated among House Republicans outlined four key defenses of Trump\'s call, claiming there was no evidence of pressure from Trump toward Volodymyr Zelensky, aid to Ukraine was released in September and Ukraine was not aware of the hold on aid at the time of the call.\n\n\'COUP HAS STARTED,\' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ANNOUNCED IN 2017\n\nKildee said Republicans keep shifting their explanations after initially claiming Trump did not ask Ukraine to investigate the Biden family. He said their stance changed after the White House released a transcript of the call.\nKellyanne Conway on public impeachment hearings, Ukraine call transcript, Nikki Haley vs. Kelly, TillersonVideo\n\n\"Saying something that is not true as part of the defense is not going to be helpful,\" said Kildee, who serves as the Democrats\' deputy whip, adding that recent testimony shows the Ukrainians did know aid was being withheld.\n\nKildee said the aid to Ukraine flowed after news reports broke about the whistleblower complaint related to the president\'s call and allegations of a quid pro quo surfaced.\n\nJOE BIDEN SAYS THERE\'S \'ZERO RATIONALE\' FOR GOP TO CALL ON SON HUNTER TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS\n\n\"There\'s going to be an effort from Republicans to get into some of the minutiae and the weeds. It is important to step back and realize that in no real world is this OK, that a president would ask a foreign power to investigate a political rival,\" said Kildee, arguing Republicans should not try to \"obfuscate\" from the main accusation.\n\n\"If we miss that point, I think it would be a mistake and be bad for the country.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHouse Democrats are moving their impeachment proceeding into open hearings this week.\n\nThe Republican memo claims they will still be “one-sided, partisan and fundamentally unfair.” The GOP authors of the letter say that Rep.

    "text": "\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday was sharply divided over President Trump\'s move to end Obama-era protections for immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children, as the justices heard oral arguments in one of the most closely watched cases of the term.\n\nMembers of the court’s conservative wing appeared wary of allowing the court to review the administration’s decision to begin phasing out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants deferral from deportation to nearly 700,000 young adult immigrants without legal status.\n\nAnd questions from conservative justices during oral arguments suggested they appeared to think the administration had supplied legally sound reasons for eliminating DACA.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, seemed concerned that authorizing a review could give judges too much power over executive agency decisions.\n\n“Can you help me understand what is the limiting principle?” Gorsuch asked Theodore Olson, one of two lawyers arguing to preserve DACA. “I hear a lot of facts, sympathetic facts, you put out there, and they speak to all of us. But what\'s the limiting principle?\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, who was closely watched as a potential swing vote, also appeared unsure about whether the court had the power to review Trump\'s decision to terminate the program.\n\nMichael Mongan, the deputy solicitor general of California, who argued for DACA alongside Olson, said the Obama administration\'s program was consistent with historical deportation-relief policies.\n\nRoberts pushed back against that assertion, saying previous administrations\' programs were far less sweeping in their use of prosecutorial discretion.\n\n“That history is not close to the number of people covered by DACA,” Roberts said.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, a Clinton appointee, also appeared uncertain about whether the court had the power to review Trump\'s decision.\n\n“I\'m saying honestly,” Breyer said, “I am struggling to get the right rule.” \n\nAt issue for the justices are two overlapping questions: Whether the courts have the right to second-guess Trump\'s action, and if Trump\'s DACA repeal was lawful.\n\nBut the oral arguments highlighted the sharp ideological split, with many of the court\'s liberal members inclined to view the DACA repeal as falling within the court\'s purview.\n\nThey also questioned whether the Trump administration had provided an adequate justification for its decision to terminate the program. Above all, the liberal justices questioned the fallout from the decision and whether the administration had appropriately weighed the ramifications of terminating DACA.\n\nOlson, a former George W. Bush solicitor general, seemed to gain ground with members of the court’s liberal wing during arguments.\n\nHe told the justices that the Trump administration’s earliest stated reason for the rollback — that DACA was illegal — was without merit, letting administration officials upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who relied on the deportation relief program without taking responsibility for the decision.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, was among several liberal justices who questioned whether the administration weighed the impact on DACA recipients, commonly known as \"Dreamers,\" who had come to rely on the program. The word “reliance” was mentioned 46 times during oral arguments. \n\nShe asked solicitor general Noel Francisco, who argued the case on behalf of the Trump administration, at what point the administration took ownership of the consequences of repeal.\n\n“Where is the political decision made clearly,” she asked, “that this is not about the law; this is about our choice to destroy lives.” \n\nBreyer seemed skeptical that the Trump administration weighed the fallout of the decision, including beyond those young adults who are DACA recipients.\n\nBreyer noted that among the friend-of-court briefs filed in this case were health care organizations, labor unions, businesses, religious groups, hundreds of educational associations and six military organizations, plus states and cities. \n\nBreyer, in a question to Francisco, said those groups had raised issues \"which are not quite the same as those of the 700,000 who have never seen any other country.\"\n\nThe court is expected to issue a ruling next summer, just months before Election Day.\n\nThe high political stakes in the case were apparent Tuesday, as large crowds of immigration rights protesters gathered on the steps of the court earlier in the morning, where they urged the justices to save the program.\n\nHours after the oral argument, Democratic lawmakers from both chambers held a press conference to rally support for legislation to protect Dreamers. Flanked by DACA recipients, both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) expressed support for the measure.\n\n\"Thank you to our Dreamers for making America more American with their hopes, optimism, courage and determination to make their future better for their families,\" Pelosi said.\n\nTrump also weighed in on the case just hours before the justices met, blasting DACA recipients.\n\n“Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from ‘angels.’ Some are very tough, hardened criminals,” Trump said in a tweet.\n\nAnd the president told the justices that if they let his repeal stand he would work with Congress to pass legislation to address the issue. “If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!\"\n\nTrump has defended his move to end the program, even as he insists that he wants a fix to resolve the issue and allow the Dreamers to stay.\n\nThe oral arguments were only the latest front in a long, contentious fight over the program.\n\nThe case traces back to 2012, when then-President Obama established DACA through executive action. Roughly 660,000 people are now enrolled in the program, which grants a renewable two-year deferral from deportation, and makes applicants eligible for work permits, driver’s licenses and health insurance.\n\nPresident Trump, who campaigned on a promise to end Obama’s “illegal executive amnesties,” announced plans in fall 2017 to rescind the program. The move was met with swift legal challenges. Federal lower court judges in three cases ruled against the Trump administration.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court on Tuesday, lawyers for the Trump administration said the lower courts erred. Francisco, the solicitor general, argued that the courts lack jurisdiction to review the repeal, and that their decisions should be vacated.\n\nIf the justices decide the repeal is reviewable, Francisco argued, the administration\'s decision should be upheld as based on legally justified reasons.\n\nFrancisco sought to persuade the court that the Trump administration rescinded DACA not only because it believed the program was illegal, but also for legitimate policy reasons.\n\nThe agency\'s rationale was spelled out in two Department of Homeland Security memos, he said, the first of which argued that Obama engaged in “an unconstitutional exercise of authority” when he set up the program in 2012 through executive action.\n\nA second memo provided additional policy reasons, including the administration\'s stance that a repeal of DACA would deter future illegal immigration.\n\nOne question that arose during arguments was whether the second Trump administration memo was an after-the-fact effort to bolster their case in the event the court determined DACA was legal.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, pushed back against an assertion from Mongan, who dismissed the second memo, written by then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, as supplying only “boilerplate” policy reasons.    \n\n“Well, can I just stop you on boilerplate?” Kavanaugh said. “This is a serious decision. We all agree with that. And it was for the secretary, presumably.\n\n\"To say in writing, even if it\'s lawful, \'I nonetheless am going to exercise my discretion,\' I assume that was a very considered decision,” Kavanaugh continued.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision will be guided by a federal statute that concerns how much decisionmaking power federal agencies have.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act will ultimately govern both of the overlapping issues at play here: if the courts have jurisdiction, and whether the repeal was legally justified or if it was “arbitrary and capricious,” and thus illegal under the act.\n\n--Updated at 5:20 p.m.\nTags Stephen Breyer Donald Trump Kirstjen Nielsen Brett Kavanaugh Sonia Sotomayor Neil Gorsuch Samuel Alito Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi Charles Schumer deferred action for childhood arrivals Supreme Court Immigration Illegal immigration\nAddThis Sharing Buttons\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Twitter\n \nLoad Comments (12,562)\nSponsored Content\n\n    You could save $699 when you switch to Progressive You could save $699 when you switch to… Progressive\n    Our Official Democratic Straw Poll is Closing Soon.

    "text": "Washington (CNN)The Republican staff on the three panels involved in the impeachment investigation have drafted a detailed memo, circulated to GOP members of all three committees and obtained by CNN, outlining their defense of President Donald Trump.\nUsing witness testimony from the closed-door depositions, as well as public reporting, the memo attempts to undercut several key arguments made by Democrats outlining the alleged culpability of Trump in his actions toward Ukraine, particularly in his decision to place a hold on US security assistance to the country in exchange for investigations into his political rival.\nThe memo marks the most centralized and detailed effort to lay out the Republican counterargument to impeachment that has been crafted and will serve as the baseline for members to utilize in their defense of Trump as the impeachment probe moves into public hearings on Wednesday.\nThe four central defenses, which are detailed over the course of the memo, are as follows:\n\n    The July 25 call summary \"shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure.\"\n    Ukrainian \"President (Volodymyr) Zelensky and President Trump have both said there was no pressure on the call.\"\n    \"The Ukrainian government was not aware of the hold on U.S. assistance\" during the July 25 call.\n    The security assistance hold was lifted on September 11. \n\n\"These four key points undercut the Democrat impeachment narrative that President Trump leveraged U.S. security assistance and a presidential meeting to force Ukraine to investigate the President\'s political rivals,\" the memo reads.\nOn Tuesday evening, Democrats released a rebuttal memo of their own. Their memo argues that the Ukrainians did feel pressure from the Trump call, they noted there were conditions placed on a White House meeting with Zelensky and that Ukrainians knew the aid had been delayed before it become public, pointing to recent testimony released as part of the impeachment inquiry.\nDuring the July 25 phone call, Zelensky brought up US military assistance to Ukraine, which has been at the center of US policy since Russia and its proxies invaded Eastern Ukraine in 2014, telling Trump that he was interested in buying additional anti-tank missiles from the US.\n\"I would like you to do us a favor though,\" Trump then says, according to a rough White House transcript. He then asks Zelensky to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election and allegations of corruption by the Bidens, despite no evidence of wrongdoing.\nThe call was included in a whistleblower\'s complaint that Trump abused his official powers \"to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up.\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted the call with Zelensky was \"perfect.\"\nOther US officials, however, got the sense that there was a quid pro quo linking US military aid to the Ukrainian investigations, according to their sworn testimony before the House committees.\nThis included Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, who had testified that it was his \"clear understanding\" that US security aid to Ukraine wouldn\'t be released unless Zelensky announced he would investigate Trump\'s political rivals.\nRepublicans say they are planning to build the case in their line of questioning that Taylor didn\'t have a \"clear understanding\" of what Trump wanted -- and that his testimony that Trump wanted \"everything\" withheld until Ukraine announced political investigations is based on a \"game of telephone,\" according to a source involved in the planning.\nSimilarly, they plan to make that a key focus of their questioning on Wednesday of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent -- that he didn\'t have direct knowledge of Trump\'s motivations.\nRepublicans say they don\'t plan to be overly aggressive with Taylor and Kent -- like the way they were with Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen -- but plan to press these two witnesses in ways to sow doubt about their understanding of what was happening in the White House.\nBuilding on the 18-page staff memo circulated Tuesday morning, Republican sources say they are trying to turn the argument to the substance after weeks of making it about the process. But expect Republicans to complain at Wednesday\'s hearing about House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\'s handling of the proceedings.\nOn Twitter Tuesday, Trump echoed some of the Republicans\' defense, pointing to Zelensky\'s comments that there was \"no pressure\" placed on him to investigate the Bidens.\nTrump claimed that the focus of the inquiry is based on second- and third-hand witnesses -- despite many of the witnesses who have testified behind closed doors having first-hand knowledge of potentially improper administration actions regarding US military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe President also reiterated his call Tuesday for former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, to testify.\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCNN\'s Marshall Cohen and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.\n\n    Paid Content\n        Know all the triggers of psoriatic arthritis.

Dylan Hernandez died following a frat party last week.\n\nUniversity officials have not released the cause of Hernandez\'s hospitalization or death, but said there is evidence that a fraternity may have been engaged in \"possible misconduct,\" CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas reports. Hernandez was in his dorm room when he fell off his bunk bed and hit his head. His roommate found him unconscious, without a pulse, the medical examiner said.\n\nSeveral students said Hernandez had been drinking heavily at a fraternity party. \"You could tell he like over partied, like, more than usual. So everyone\'s like, \'whoa, like just make sure he\'s like okay,\'\" said student Piper Grant.\n\nSDSU did not reveal the name of the frat that hosted the party Hernandez attended, but he was pledging to one of the suspended fraternities, Phi Gamma Delta. According to the school\'s student newspaper, the chapter was placed on probation in 2017 after being \"found in violation of regulations pertaining to alcohol at off-campus fraternity events.\"\n\nStudents have had longstanding concerns about Greek life at the university and said alcohol violations stretch across campus.\n\n\"It\'s like the party culture,\" said Natalie Friedrichsen, a San Diego State University alumnus. \"They just kind of get used to it and then, they don\'t think cause like, they\'re having a good time.\"\n\nStudent Gwenyth Crise said she hopes the suspension of the fraternities leads to the university taking action on the issue. \"This has been a problem for a while. We\'ve seen alcohol abuse on this campus,\" she said. \"So hopefully this will create a healthier environment for the school.\"\n\nMeanwhile, tributes were pouring in for Hernandez. \"My heart goes out to him, his friends, his family,\" said Matthew Flanders, another student.\n\nFriends of the Hernandez family have put up a GoFundMe page to raise money to \"help to create memorials for family and friends as a way to grieve.\"\n\nThe San Diego Police Department is not yet involved in the case.  It would only take over if Hernandez\'s death is ruled a homicide by the medical examiner\'s office."

Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart writer who was fired in 2017 over her anti-Muslim tweets and then later renounced by the far right, told SPLC that Miller was introduced to her to help shape her coverage at the site. Throughout their correspondence, Miller promoted racist ideas, sending her links from the white-nationalist website VDARE and recommending The Camp of the Saints, a French novel popular among neo-Nazis for its perpetuation of the “white genocide” myth. McHugh also told SPLC that in July 2015 Miller suggested she use information from an article on the white-nationalist website American Renaissance about interracial crime. In another email to McHugh, Miller criticized the removal of Confederate monuments and flags after mass shooter Dylann Roof opened fire on a South Carolina church, killing nine people."

But his pointed comments, at a private gathering last Wednesday at Morgan Stanley’s global investment event in Miami, painted a dark image of a president and his family whose potential personal gain is at the heart of decision-making, according to people who were present for his remarks.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nBolton served as Trump’s national security adviser for 17 months. The Ukraine scandal began to unfold about a week after his contentious departure. Trump said he’d fired him, though Bolton said he had resigned.\n\nMultiple people who attended Bolton’s private speech in Miami did not recall him mentioning Ukraine but said he told attendees that he had kept a resignation letter in his desk for three months. Bolton declined to comment for this article.\n\nBolton is a potential linchpin witness in the inquiry into Trump’s efforts to elicit help from the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, given his central role in the White House during that time. The impeachment inquiry moves to public testimony this week.\n\nCurrent and former administration officials have testified about Bolton’s strong opposition to the Ukraine pressure effort, which was led by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and allegedly involved withholding military aid and a presidential meeting until the Ukrainian government publicly committed to investigations, including into 2016 U.S. election interference and a business associated with Biden\'s son Hunter.\n\nBolton’s lawyer teased his client\'s value last week in a letter to House Democrats that noted that the former national security adviser had been present for “many relevant meetings and conversations” on Ukraine, including some that have yet to be disclosed to investigators. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, said Bolton is willing to testify if a federal court approves it and issues a ruling that essentially says he can defy the White House’s position that he can’t speak to Congress.\n\nBolton, a long-time foreign policy hawk who also served in the administration of President George W. Bush, expressed support in his private remarks for Trump’s stance against China on trade, people present said. But Trump and Bolton had a litany of policy differences — on Iran, North Korea, Syria and, apparently, Ukraine.\n\nBolton told the gathering of Morgan Stanley’s largest hedge fund clients that he was most frustrated with Trump over his handling of Turkey, people who were present said. Noting the broad bipartisan support in Congress to sanction Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan purchased a Russian missile defense system, Bolton said Trump’s resistance to the move was unreasonable, four people present for his speech said.\n\nBolton said he believes there is a personal or business relationship dictating Trump’s position on Turkey because none of his advisers are aligned with him on the issue, the people present said.\nRecommended\nImpeachment Inquiry\nPhotographer captures Trump\'s handwritten talking points responding to Sondland\nImpeachment Inquiry\nTrump claims Sondland testimony exonerates him: \'It\'s all over\'\n\nThe Trump Organization has a property in Istanbul, and the president\'s daughter Ivanka Trump attended the opening with Erdogan in 2012. Though it’s a leasing agreement for use of the Trump name, Trump himself said in a 2015 interview that the arrangement presented “a little conflict of interest” should he be elected.\n\nDuring an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan, Trump agreed to pull back U.S. troops from northeast Syria so Turkish forces could launch an attack against America’s Kurdish allies in the area. The presence of U.S. forces had deterred Erdogan from invading Syria, which he had threatened to do for years. Trump’s decision, followed by an order for all U.S. troops to exit Syria, was widely criticized even among the president’s Republican allies and was seen by many as a gift to the Turkish leader.\n\nErdogan is set to visit the White House on Wednesday.\n\nLike other former Trump advisers, Bolton said regardless of how much evidence is provided to Trump that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the president refuses to take any action because he views any move against Moscow as giving credence to the notion that his election is invalid, the people present for Bolton\'s remarks said.\n\nAt one point in his closed-door remarks, Bolton was asked what he thinks will happen in January 2021 if Trump is re-elected, people present for his remarks said. Bolton responded by taking a swipe at Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump — both of whom are senior White House advisers — and at Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., three people familiar with his remarks said.\n\nBolton said Trump could go full isolationist — with the faction of the Republican Party that aligns with Paul’s foreign policy views taking over the GOP — and could withdraw the U.S. from NATO and other international alliances, three people present for his remarks said.\n\nHe also suggested that Kushner and Ivanka Trump could convince the president to rewrite his legacy and nominate a liberal like Lawrence Tribe — a Harvard Law professor who has questioned Trump’s fitness for office and was a legal adviser to Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign — to the Supreme Court, the people present for Bolton\'s speech said.\n\nBolton said, with an eye roll that suggested he doesn’t take them seriously, that Kushner and Ivanka Trump could do so in an attempt to prove they had real influence and were in the White House representing the people they want to be in social circles with at home in New York City, the people present for his remarks said.\n\nThose present said that at that point, the audience appeared shocked.\n\nBolton has been writing a book, having reached a deal with Simon & Schuster, and people present for his remarks in Miami said he suggested to the audience several times that if they read it, there would be much more material along the lines of what was in his speech.\nIMAGE: Stephanie RuhleStephanie Ruhle\nCarol E.

    "text": "Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \n\nNo matter what they might sometimes say in public, airlines are doing quite well.\n\nDemand for air travel is strong. Tolerance of air travel is stable.\n\nIndeed, one of the more successful airline stories of late has been the airline formerly known as Complete Intolerance Airlines: United.\n\nIt\'s performed something akin to an emotional resurgence. Its share price is rising, thanks to an improved earnings forecast.\n\nThis doesn\'t mean, however, that United has suddenly wrapped itself in glorious generosity.\n\nLet us, then, take an excursion to Guam.\n\nThere, United is fighting a proposal that would increase Guam airport fees from $9 million a year to $15 million.\n\nUnited isn\'t happy about this.\n\nAs my sadly irregular reading of the Guam Daily Post tells me, the airline emitted this statement: \n\n    Any proposals to increase costs of air travel will reduce demand and ultimately have a negative effect on travel, trade, commerce, and tourism. Rather than increasing fees, we encourage Guam agencies to work with the industry on finding other solutions than a tax on travel.\n\nI read this several times, wondering why strange noises were occurring in my head.\n\nMy eyebrows and nasal tract seemed to be palpitating at alarming levels.\n\nThen I realized. It was the shock of learning that United Airlines is actually against fees.\n\nIndeed, United is insisting that any fee increase that affects air travel will lead to a diminution in passenger numbers.\n\nSo how is it, I hear you mutter with me, that United has merrily levied more and more fees on passengers in recent years?\n\nThere\'s the much-loved baggage fee, the pay-for-an-overhead-bin fee, the you-want-to-change-your-flight-give-us-200-bucks fee, and the delightful oh-you-want-an-aisle-seat-that\'ll-cost-you fee.\n\nThis is the airline whose president, Scott Kirby, insisted that getting on a plane is like going to a concert.\n\nEvery seat, he said, should have its own price. If families want to sit together, they should pay for the privilege. Pay a fee, that is.\n\nKirby subsequently confessed that the concert analogy may not have been the finest.\n\nBut airlines like United have embraced the onerous fee-ling with cynical gusto.\n\nThe mentality has been clear for some time. Airlines want to find a way to get passengers to pay for everything they used to think was free. So they charge a fee.\n\nSadly, in a U.S. market where four airlines own more than 80 percent of all the seats, passengers often feel they have little choice but to pay.\n\nEspecially when most airlines coincidentally charge precisely the same fees. (Southwest, alone, attempts to resist change fees and baggage fees.)\n\nPassengers feel they\'re a captive audience, desperate to get from one place to another. So they tolerate the ever-advancing fees and grumble mightily.\n\nSomehow, these fees don\'t seem to have affected United\'s business. Other than increasing its profits, that is.\n\nYet here is Guam trying to raise a fee and United bleating that there\'ll be a negative effect on travel.\n\nDon\'t you feel sorry for the airline?"

    "text": "A former McDonald\'s employee says a male co-worker at a Michigan restaurant routinely grabbed her breasts and buttocks and propositioned her for sex — allegations laid out in a new class-action lawsuit that accuses McDonald\'s of a \"culture of sexual harassment.\"\n\nThe lawsuit against McDonald\'s and its Michigan franchise is the latest allegation of rampant abuse and harassment of female employees at the fast-food chain. Lawyers representing workers say more than 50 claims and charges of harassment of female employees are pending against McDonald\'s in courts and at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nTheir accusations drew new focus last week when McDonald\'s fired its CEO, Steve Easterbrook, over a consensual relationship with an employee. He is not accused of sexual harassment, but the relationship violated company policy. Still, Easterbrook is receiving a multi-million-dollar exit package.\nMcDonald\'s Fired CEO Is Getting Millions, Putting Spotlight On Pay Gap\nBusiness\nMcDonald\'s Fired CEO Is Getting Millions, Putting Spotlight On Pay Gap\n\nTuesday\'s lawsuit by former McDonald\'s employee Jenna Ries points to Easterbrook\'s firing to allege that McDonald\'s as a corporation \"creates and permits a toxic work culture from the very top.\"\n\nIn the lawsuit, Ries says a store manager repeatedly harassed her, called her names, pulled her hair, and at one point, when they were working next to each other in the kitchen, even \"placed his penis\" in her hand. According to the filing, Ries witnessed similar harassment of other women and girls, and reported the co-worker to the general manager — but the behavior continued.\n\nMore than 50 women who have worked at the Michigan franchise could join her class-action suit if it\'s recognized, according to the filing. The lawsuit seeks $5 million in damages for workers at the Mason, Mich., location.\n\nThe vast majority of McDonald\'s restaurants are owned by franchisees. But the lawsuit says the corporation, too, has failed to address the \"systemic sexual harassment\" and therefore enabled it.\nProtests Over Sexual Harassment At McDonald\'s Grow As Shareholders Meet\nBusiness\nProtests Over Sexual Harassment At McDonald\'s Grow As Shareholders Meet\n\n\"This is not just about me,\" Ries told reporters on Tuesday. \"This is about countless McDonald\'s workers around the country who have survived sexual harassment on the job. We deserve to feel safe at work.\"\n\nMcDonald\'s, in a statement, said it was \"demonstrating its continued commitment\" to the issue by adding a new anti-harassment training program to all corporate-owned restaurants. It also said it was \"encouraged\" by the progress getting franchisees to implement the training.\n\n\"There is a deeply important conversation around safe and respectful workplaces in communities throughout the U.S. and around the world, and McDonald\'s is demonstrating its continued commitment to this issue,\" McDonald\'s said in the statement.\nPost-#MeToo, Ernst & Young Grapples With Diverging Views Of Its Culture\nBusiness\nPost-#MeToo, Ernst & Young Grapples With Diverging Views Of Its Culture\n\nIn May, McDonald\'s workers across the U.S. staged protests against low pay and the company\'s handling of alleged sexual harassment. That\'s when workers filed numerous complaints against McDonald\'s, with the backing of the Time\'s Up Legal Defense Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union and the labor group Fight for $15.\n\nThe groups say they expected hundreds of workers in Michigan to join a new strike on Tuesday."
