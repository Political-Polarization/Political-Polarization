    "text": "Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., pushed back Tuesday on the defenses being offered by the White House and Republicans for President Trump\'s phone call with the president of Ukraine, which has prompted an impeachment inquiry that will move to public hearings this week.\n\nKildee responded to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway saying earlier on \"America\'s Newsroom\" that Democrats want to overturn the results of the 2016 election through impeachment and do not want to run against Trump next year.\n\nA memo circulated among House Republicans outlined four key defenses of Trump\'s call, claiming there was no evidence of pressure from Trump toward Volodymyr Zelensky, aid to Ukraine was released in September and Ukraine was not aware of the hold on aid at the time of the call.\n\n\'COUP HAS STARTED,\' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ANNOUNCED IN 2017\n\nKildee said Republicans keep shifting their explanations after initially claiming Trump did not ask Ukraine to investigate the Biden family. He said their stance changed after the White House released a transcript of the call.\nKellyanne Conway on public impeachment hearings, Ukraine call transcript, Nikki Haley vs. Kelly, TillersonVideo\n\n\"Saying something that is not true as part of the defense is not going to be helpful,\" said Kildee, who serves as the Democrats\' deputy whip, adding that recent testimony shows the Ukrainians did know aid was being withheld.\n\nKildee said the aid to Ukraine flowed after news reports broke about the whistleblower complaint related to the president\'s call and allegations of a quid pro quo surfaced.\n\nJOE BIDEN SAYS THERE\'S \'ZERO RATIONALE\' FOR GOP TO CALL ON SON HUNTER TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS\n\n\"There\'s going to be an effort from Republicans to get into some of the minutiae and the weeds. It is important to step back and realize that in no real world is this OK, that a president would ask a foreign power to investigate a political rival,\" said Kildee, arguing Republicans should not try to \"obfuscate\" from the main accusation.\n\n\"If we miss that point, I think it would be a mistake and be bad for the country.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHouse Democrats are moving their impeachment proceeding into open hearings this week.\n\nThe Republican memo claims they will still be “one-sided, partisan and fundamentally unfair.” The GOP authors of the letter say that Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has been leading the impeachment inquiry from his \"Capitol basement bunker.\"\n\nThe closed-door impeachment inquiry has generated more than 100 hours of testimony from 15 witnesses.\n\nFox News\' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

    "text": "\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday was sharply divided over President Trump\'s move to end Obama-era protections for immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children, as the justices heard oral arguments in one of the most closely watched cases of the term.\n\nMembers of the court’s conservative wing appeared wary of allowing the court to review the administration’s decision to begin phasing out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants deferral from deportation to nearly 700,000 young adult immigrants without legal status.\n\nAnd questions from conservative justices during oral arguments suggested they appeared to think the administration had supplied legally sound reasons for eliminating DACA.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, seemed concerned that authorizing a review could give judges too much power over executive agency decisions.\n\n“Can you help me understand what is the limiting principle?” Gorsuch asked Theodore Olson, one of two lawyers arguing to preserve DACA. “I hear a lot of facts, sympathetic facts, you put out there, and they speak to all of us. But what\'s the limiting principle?\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, who was closely watched as a potential swing vote, also appeared unsure about whether the court had the power to review Trump\'s decision to terminate the program.\n\nMichael Mongan, the deputy solicitor general of California, who argued for DACA alongside Olson, said the Obama administration\'s program was consistent with historical deportation-relief policies.\n\nRoberts pushed back against that assertion, saying previous administrations\' programs were far less sweeping in their use of prosecutorial discretion.\n\n“That history is not close to the number of people covered by DACA,” Roberts said.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, a Clinton appointee, also appeared uncertain about whether the court had the power to review Trump\'s decision.\n\n“I\'m saying honestly,” Breyer said, “I am struggling to get the right rule.” \n\nAt issue for the justices are two overlapping questions: Whether the courts have the right to second-guess Trump\'s action, and if Trump\'s DACA repeal was lawful.\n\nBut the oral arguments highlighted the sharp ideological split, with many of the court\'s liberal members inclined to view the DACA repeal as falling within the court\'s purview.\n\nThey also questioned whether the Trump administration had provided an adequate justification for its decision to terminate the program. Above all, the liberal justices questioned the fallout from the decision and whether the administration had appropriately weighed the ramifications of terminating DACA.\n\nOlson, a former George W. Bush solicitor general, seemed to gain ground with members of the court’s liberal wing during arguments.\n\nHe told the justices that the Trump administration’s earliest stated reason for the rollback — that DACA was illegal — was without merit, letting administration officials upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who relied on the deportation relief program without taking responsibility for the decision.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, was among several liberal justices who questioned whether the administration weighed the impact on DACA recipients, commonly known as \"Dreamers,\" who had come to rely on the program. The word “reliance” was mentioned 46 times during oral arguments. \n\nShe asked solicitor general Noel Francisco, who argued the case on behalf of the Trump administration, at what point the administration took ownership of the consequences of repeal.\n\n“Where is the political decision made clearly,” she asked, “that this is not about the law; this is about our choice to destroy lives.” \n\nBreyer seemed skeptical that the Trump administration weighed the fallout of the decision, including beyond those young adults who are DACA recipients.\n\nBreyer noted that among the friend-of-court briefs filed in this case were health care organizations, labor unions, businesses, religious groups, hundreds of educational associations and six military organizations, plus states and cities. \n\nBreyer, in a question to Francisco, said those groups had raised issues \"which are not quite the same as those of the 700,000 who have never seen any other country.\"\n\nThe court is expected to issue a ruling next summer, just months before Election Day.\n\nThe high political stakes in the case were apparent Tuesday, as large crowds of immigration rights protesters gathered on the steps of the court earlier in the morning, where they urged the justices to save the program.\n\nHours after the oral argument, Democratic lawmakers from both chambers held a press conference to rally support for legislation to protect Dreamers. Flanked by DACA recipients, both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) expressed support for the measure.\n\n\"Thank you to our Dreamers for making America more American with their hopes, optimism, courage and determination to make their future better for their families,\" Pelosi said.\n\nTrump also weighed in on the case just hours before the justices met, blasting DACA recipients.\n\n“Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from ‘angels.’ Some are very tough, hardened criminals,” Trump said in a tweet.\n\nAnd the president told the justices that if they let his repeal stand he would work with Congress to pass legislation to address the issue. “If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!\"\n\nTrump has defended his move to end the program, even as he insists that he wants a fix to resolve the issue and allow the Dreamers to stay.\n\nThe oral arguments were only the latest front in a long, contentious fight over the program.\n\nThe case traces back to 2012, when then-President Obama established DACA through executive action. Roughly 660,000 people are now enrolled in the program, which grants a renewable two-year deferral from deportation, and makes applicants eligible for work permits, driver’s licenses and health insurance.\n\nPresident Trump, who campaigned on a promise to end Obama’s “illegal executive amnesties,” announced plans in fall 2017 to rescind the program. The move was met with swift legal challenges. Federal lower court judges in three cases ruled against the Trump administration.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court on Tuesday, lawyers for the Trump administration said the lower courts erred. Francisco, the solicitor general, argued that the courts lack jurisdiction to review the repeal, and that their decisions should be vacated.\n\nIf the justices decide the repeal is reviewable, Francisco argued, the administration\'s decision should be upheld as based on legally justified reasons.\n\nFrancisco sought to persuade the court that the Trump administration rescinded DACA not only because it believed the program was illegal, but also for legitimate policy reasons.\n\nThe agency\'s rationale was spelled out in two Department of Homeland Security memos, he said, the first of which argued that Obama engaged in “an unconstitutional exercise of authority” when he set up the program in 2012 through executive action.\n\nA second memo provided additional policy reasons, including the administration\'s stance that a repeal of DACA would deter future illegal immigration.\n\nOne question that arose during arguments was whether the second Trump administration memo was an after-the-fact effort to bolster their case in the event the court determined DACA was legal.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, pushed back against an assertion from Mongan, who dismissed the second memo, written by then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, as supplying only “boilerplate” policy reasons.    \n\n“Well, can I just stop you on boilerplate?” Kavanaugh said. “This is a serious decision. We all agree with that. And it was for the secretary, presumably.\n\n\"To say in writing, even if it\'s lawful, \'I nonetheless am going to exercise my discretion,\' I assume that was a very considered decision,” Kavanaugh continued.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision will be guided by a federal statute that concerns how much decisionmaking power federal agencies have.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act will ultimately govern both of the overlapping issues at play here: if the courts have jurisdiction, and whether the repeal was legally justified or if it was “arbitrary and capricious,” and thus illegal under the act.\n\n--Updated at 5:20 p.m.\nTags Stephen Breyer Donald Trump Kirstjen Nielsen Brett Kavanaugh Sonia Sotomayor Neil Gorsuch Samuel Alito Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi Charles Schumer deferred action for childhood arrivals Supreme Court Immigration Illegal immigration\nAddThis Sharing Buttons\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Twitter\n \nLoad Comments (12,562)\nSponsored Content\n\n    You could save $699 when you switch to Progressive You could save $699 when you switch to… Progressive\n    Our Official Democratic Straw Poll is Closing Soon.

    "text": "Washington (CNN)The Republican staff on the three panels involved in the impeachment investigation have drafted a detailed memo, circulated to GOP members of all three committees and obtained by CNN, outlining their defense of President Donald Trump.\nUsing witness testimony from the closed-door depositions, as well as public reporting, the memo attempts to undercut several key arguments made by Democrats outlining the alleged culpability of Trump in his actions toward Ukraine, particularly in his decision to place a hold on US security assistance to the country in exchange for investigations into his political rival.\nThe memo marks the most centralized and detailed effort to lay out the Republican counterargument to impeachment that has been crafted and will serve as the baseline for members to utilize in their defense of Trump as the impeachment probe moves into public hearings on Wednesday.\nThe four central defenses, which are detailed over the course of the memo, are as follows:\n\n    The July 25 call summary \"shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure.\"\n    Ukrainian \"President (Volodymyr) Zelensky and President Trump have both said there was no pressure on the call.\"\n    \"The Ukrainian government was not aware of the hold on U.S. assistance\" during the July 25 call.\n    The security assistance hold was lifted on September 11. \n\n\"These four key points undercut the Democrat impeachment narrative that President Trump leveraged U.S. security assistance and a presidential meeting to force Ukraine to investigate the President\'s political rivals,\" the memo reads.\nOn Tuesday evening, Democrats released a rebuttal memo of their own. Their memo argues that the Ukrainians did feel pressure from the Trump call, they noted there were conditions placed on a White House meeting with Zelensky and that Ukrainians knew the aid had been delayed before it become public, pointing to recent testimony released as part of the impeachment inquiry.\nDuring the July 25 phone call, Zelensky brought up US military assistance to Ukraine, which has been at the center of US policy since Russia and its proxies invaded Eastern Ukraine in 2014, telling Trump that he was interested in buying additional anti-tank missiles from the US.\n\"I would like you to do us a favor though,\" Trump then says, according to a rough White House transcript. He then asks Zelensky to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election and allegations of corruption by the Bidens, despite no evidence of wrongdoing.\nThe call was included in a whistleblower\'s complaint that Trump abused his official powers \"to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up.\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted the call with Zelensky was \"perfect.\"\nOther US officials, however, got the sense that there was a quid pro quo linking US military aid to the Ukrainian investigations, according to their sworn testimony before the House committees.\nThis included Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, who had testified that it was his \"clear understanding\" that US security aid to Ukraine wouldn\'t be released unless Zelensky announced he would investigate Trump\'s political rivals.\nRepublicans say they are planning to build the case in their line of questioning that Taylor didn\'t have a \"clear understanding\" of what Trump wanted -- and that his testimony that Trump wanted \"everything\" withheld until Ukraine announced political investigations is based on a \"game of telephone,\" according to a source involved in the planning.\nSimilarly, they plan to make that a key focus of their questioning on Wednesday of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent -- that he didn\'t have direct knowledge of Trump\'s motivations.\nRepublicans say they don\'t plan to be overly aggressive with Taylor and Kent -- like the way they were with Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen -- but plan to press these two witnesses in ways to sow doubt about their understanding of what was happening in the White House.\nBuilding on the 18-page staff memo circulated Tuesday morning, Republican sources say they are trying to turn the argument to the substance after weeks of making it about the process. But expect Republicans to complain at Wednesday\'s hearing about House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\'s handling of the proceedings.\nOn Twitter Tuesday, Trump echoed some of the Republicans\' defense, pointing to Zelensky\'s comments that there was \"no pressure\" placed on him to investigate the Bidens.\nTrump claimed that the focus of the inquiry is based on second- and third-hand witnesses -- despite many of the witnesses who have testified behind closed doors having first-hand knowledge of potentially improper administration actions regarding US military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe President also reiterated his call Tuesday for former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, to testify.\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCNN\'s Marshall Cohen and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.\n\n    Paid Content\n        Know all the triggers of psoriatic arthritis.

    "text": "Fourteen fraternities at San Diego State University are under suspension after the death of a 19-year-old freshman. Dylan Hernandez died following a frat party last week.\n\nUniversity officials have not released the cause of Hernandez\'s hospitalization or death, but said there is evidence that a fraternity may have been engaged in \"possible misconduct,\" CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas reports. Hernandez was in his dorm room when he fell off his bunk bed and hit his head. His roommate found him unconscious, without a pulse, the medical examiner said.\n\nSeveral students said Hernandez had been drinking heavily at a fraternity party. \"You could tell he like over partied, like, more than usual. So everyone\'s like, \'whoa, like just make sure he\'s like okay,\'\" said student Piper Grant.\n\nSDSU did not reveal the name of the frat that hosted the party Hernandez attended, but he was pledging to one of the suspended fraternities, Phi Gamma Delta. According to the school\'s student newspaper, the chapter was placed on probation in 2017 after being \"found in violation of regulations pertaining to alcohol at off-campus fraternity events.\"\n\nStudents have had longstanding concerns about Greek life at the university and said alcohol violations stretch across campus.\n\n\"It\'s like the party culture,\" said Natalie Friedrichsen, a San Diego State University alumnus. \"They just kind of get used to it and then, they don\'t think cause like, they\'re having a good time.\"\n\nStudent Gwenyth Crise said she hopes the suspension of the fraternities leads to the university taking action on the issue. \"This has been a problem for a while. We\'ve seen alcohol abuse on this campus,\" she said. \"So hopefully this will create a healthier environment for the school.\"\n\nMeanwhile, tributes were pouring in for Hernandez. \"My heart goes out to him, his friends, his family,\" said Matthew Flanders, another student.\n\nFriends of the Hernandez family have put up a GoFundMe page to raise money to \"help to create memorials for family and friends as a way to grieve.\"\n\nThe San Diego Police Department is not yet involved in the case.  It would only take over if Hernandez\'s death is ruled a homicide by the medical examiner\'s office."

Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart writer who was fired in 2017 over her anti-Muslim tweets and then later renounced by the far right, told SPLC that Miller was introduced to her to help shape her coverage at the site. Throughout their correspondence, Miller promoted racist ideas, sending her links from the white-nationalist website VDARE and recommending The Camp of the Saints, a French novel popular among neo-Nazis for its perpetuation of the “white genocide” myth. McHugh also told SPLC that in July 2015 Miller suggested she use information from an article on the white-nationalist website American Renaissance about interracial crime. In another email to McHugh, Miller criticized the removal of Confederate monuments and flags after mass shooter Dylann Roof opened fire on a South Carolina church, killing nine people."

Trump said he’d fired him, though Bolton said he had resigned.\n\nMultiple people who attended Bolton’s private speech in Miami did not recall him mentioning Ukraine but said he told attendees that he had kept a resignation letter in his desk for three months. Bolton declined to comment for this article.\n\nBolton is a potential linchpin witness in the inquiry into Trump’s efforts to elicit help from the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, given his central role in the White House during that time. The impeachment inquiry moves to public testimony this week.\n\nCurrent and former administration officials have testified about Bolton’s strong opposition to the Ukraine pressure effort, which was led by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and allegedly involved withholding military aid and a presidential meeting until the Ukrainian government publicly committed to investigations, including into 2016 U.S. election interference and a business associated with Biden\'s son Hunter.\n\nBolton’s lawyer teased his client\'s value last week in a letter to House Democrats that noted that the former national security adviser had been present for “many relevant meetings and conversations” on Ukraine, including some that have yet to be disclosed to investigators. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, said Bolton is willing to testify if a federal court approves it and issues a ruling that essentially says he can defy the White House’s position that he can’t speak to Congress.\n\nBolton, a long-time foreign policy hawk who also served in the administration of President George W. Bush, expressed support in his private remarks for Trump’s stance against China on trade, people present said. But Trump and Bolton had a litany of policy differences — on Iran, North Korea, Syria and, apparently, Ukraine.\n\nBolton told the gathering of Morgan Stanley’s largest hedge fund clients that he was most frustrated with Trump over his handling of Turkey, people who were present said. Noting the broad bipartisan support in Congress to sanction Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan purchased a Russian missile defense system, Bolton said Trump’s resistance to the move was unreasonable, four people present for his speech said.\n\nBolton said he believes there is a personal or business relationship dictating Trump’s position on Turkey because none of his advisers are aligned with him on the issue, the people present said.\nRecommended\nImpeachment Inquiry\nPhotographer captures Trump\'s handwritten talking points responding to Sondland\nImpeachment Inquiry\nTrump claims Sondland testimony exonerates him: \'It\'s all over\'\n\nThe Trump Organization has a property in Istanbul, and the president\'s daughter Ivanka Trump attended the opening with Erdogan in 2012. Though it’s a leasing agreement for use of the Trump name, Trump himself said in a 2015 interview that the arrangement presented “a little conflict of interest” should he be elected.\n\nDuring an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan, Trump agreed to pull back U.S. troops from northeast Syria so Turkish forces could launch an attack against America’s Kurdish allies in the area. The presence of U.S. forces had deterred Erdogan from invading Syria, which he had threatened to do for years. Trump’s decision, followed by an order for all U.S. troops to exit Syria, was widely criticized even among the president’s Republican allies and was seen by many as a gift to the Turkish leader.\n\nErdogan is set to visit the White House on Wednesday.\n\nLike other former Trump advisers, Bolton said regardless of how much evidence is provided to Trump that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the president refuses to take any action because he views any move against Moscow as giving credence to the notion that his election is invalid, the people present for Bolton\'s remarks said.\n\nAt one point in his closed-door remarks, Bolton was asked what he thinks will happen in January 2021 if Trump is re-elected, people present for his remarks said. Bolton responded by taking a swipe at Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump — both of whom are senior White House advisers — and at Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., three people familiar with his remarks said.\n\nBolton said Trump could go full isolationist — with the faction of the Republican Party that aligns with Paul’s foreign policy views taking over the GOP — and could withdraw the U.S. from NATO and other international alliances, three people present for his remarks said.\n\nHe also suggested that Kushner and Ivanka Trump could convince the president to rewrite his legacy and nominate a liberal like Lawrence Tribe — a Harvard Law professor who has questioned Trump’s fitness for office and was a legal adviser to Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign — to the Supreme Court, the people present for Bolton\'s speech said.\n\nBolton said, with an eye roll that suggested he doesn’t take them seriously, that Kushner and Ivanka Trump could do so in an attempt to prove they had real influence and were in the White House representing the people they want to be in social circles with at home in New York City, the people present for his remarks said.\n\nThose present said that at that point, the audience appeared shocked.\n\nBolton has been writing a book, having reached a deal with Simon & Schuster, and people present for his remarks in Miami said he suggested to the audience several times that if they read it, there would be much more material along the lines of what was in his speech.\nIMAGE: Stephanie RuhleStephanie Ruhle\nCarol E.

    "text": "Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \n\nNo matter what they might sometimes say in public, airlines are doing quite well.\n\nDemand for air travel is strong. Tolerance of air travel is stable.\n\nIndeed, one of the more successful airline stories of late has been the airline formerly known as Complete Intolerance Airlines: United.\n\nIt\'s performed something akin to an emotional resurgence. Its share price is rising, thanks to an improved earnings forecast.\n\nThis doesn\'t mean, however, that United has suddenly wrapped itself in glorious generosity.\n\nLet us, then, take an excursion to Guam.\n\nThere, United is fighting a proposal that would increase Guam airport fees from $9 million a year to $15 million.\n\nUnited isn\'t happy about this.\n\nAs my sadly irregular reading of the Guam Daily Post tells me, the airline emitted this statement: \n\n    Any proposals to increase costs of air travel will reduce demand and ultimately have a negative effect on travel, trade, commerce, and tourism. Rather than increasing fees, we encourage Guam agencies to work with the industry on finding other solutions than a tax on travel.\n\nI read this several times, wondering why strange noises were occurring in my head.\n\nMy eyebrows and nasal tract seemed to be palpitating at alarming levels.\n\nThen I realized. It was the shock of learning that United Airlines is actually against fees.\n\nIndeed, United is insisting that any fee increase that affects air travel will lead to a diminution in passenger numbers.\n\nSo how is it, I hear you mutter with me, that United has merrily levied more and more fees on passengers in recent years?\n\nThere\'s the much-loved baggage fee, the pay-for-an-overhead-bin fee, the you-want-to-change-your-flight-give-us-200-bucks fee, and the delightful oh-you-want-an-aisle-seat-that\'ll-cost-you fee.\n\nThis is the airline whose president, Scott Kirby, insisted that getting on a plane is like going to a concert.\n\nEvery seat, he said, should have its own price. If families want to sit together, they should pay for the privilege. Pay a fee, that is.\n\nKirby subsequently confessed that the concert analogy may not have been the finest.\n\nBut airlines like United have embraced the onerous fee-ling with cynical gusto.\n\nThe mentality has been clear for some time. Airlines want to find a way to get passengers to pay for everything they used to think was free. So they charge a fee.\n\nSadly, in a U.S. market where four airlines own more than 80 percent of all the seats, passengers often feel they have little choice but to pay.\n\nEspecially when most airlines coincidentally charge precisely the same fees. (Southwest, alone, attempts to resist change fees and baggage fees.)\n\nPassengers feel they\'re a captive audience, desperate to get from one place to another. So they tolerate the ever-advancing fees and grumble mightily.\n\nSomehow, these fees don\'t seem to have affected United\'s business. Other than increasing its profits, that is.\n\nYet here is Guam trying to raise a fee and United bleating that there\'ll be a negative effect on travel.\n\nDon\'t you feel sorry for the airline?"

Trump's three attorney general appointees \u2014 Jeff Sessions, Matthew Whitaker and William Barr \u2014 have each escaped serious scrutiny from an inspector general who investigated Eric Holder, Obama's first attorney general, and many of his top deputies. It's a record that puzzles his allies and infuriates critics.\n\n\"I don't have so much of a problem with Horowitz investigating some of the allegations surrounding the 2016 election, because that's his job,\" said Matthew Miller, a Democratic former DOJ spokesman and NBC News legal analyst. \"But it is striking to me that with all of Barr's known misconduct, all of the instances of conversations between senior leadership and the White House, there doesn't seem to have been a single investigation into any that.\"\n\nBarr disputes that he has engaged in misconduct. Congressional Democrats argue he has done the political bidding of the president and has improperly discussed sensitive cases with the White House, including the special counsel's Russia probe. They have also questioned the premise of the ongoing criminal investigation that Barr commissioned into its origins.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n    Share this -\n\n2h ago / 8:39 AM CST\nWhy it matters Trump knew about whistleblower before releasing Ukraine aid\nNov. 26, 201905:45\n\n    Share this -\n\nShannon Pettypiece and Monica Alba\n2h ago / 8:38 AM CST\nTrump denies investigation link to Ukraine aid amid new timeline revelations\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued to deny any connection between investigations and security funding to Ukraine as new details emerged about when the aid was frozen and when Trump knew about the whistleblower complaint.\nPres.

Whether you\u2019re hopping on a plane, sitting in car traffic, or cooking up a storm at home, here are nine Vox podcast episodes that are bound to teach you something new \u2014 about something other than impeachment. Happy listening.\nOK, boomer\n\nToday, Explained | At this point, you\u2019ve probably heard the phrase from the popular TikTok meme that pits the Youths against the Olds. But the truth about this generational standoff can be found in its shades of gray. Vox\u2019s Aja Romano joins host Sean Rameswaram on to walk through what this TikTok trend is all about. In the second half of the show, Vox\u2019s Brian Resnick examines generational divides through a scientific lens to try to understand why they\u2019re so persistent; memory and bias are two big factors at play.\n\nKen Burns on \u201CCountry Music,\u201D digital documentaries, and why \u201Cthere\u2019s no them, there\u2019s only us\u201D\n\nRecode Decode | Filmmaker Ken Burns talks with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher about his latest documentary series \u201CCountry Music,\u201D in which he explores the history of the genre, its place in the larger American musical landscape, and the powerful universality of \u201Cthree chords and the truth.\u201D Burns says that, unlike rock and jazz, country music is largely a story about powerful women, and also unpacks the ways in which it reflects the intermingling ethnic diversity of the US.\nAmazon\u2019s Middlewomen\n\nReset | As increasingly more shopping is done online, the solutions online retailers devise to meet delivery demands have become ever more patchworked. One such workaround is something called a prepping center, where third-party retailers \u2014 people who use Amazon to sell their own stuff \u2014 send packages to be repackaged to Amazon\u2019s standards. This system is so popular that there\u2019s a very good chance your order will pass through Roundup, Montana \u2014 population 1,863 \u2014 this holiday season. Listen to find out why this system is so necessary for your package to make its way to your doorstep on time.\n\nNoise will be noise\n\nToday, Explained | Noise is an extremely old problem. The earliest recorded noise complaint is 4,000 years old. Noise has even been used as a weapon by the US military; heavy metal was blasted at dictator Manuel Noriega\u2019s hideout to force him to surrender, explains The Atlantic contributing writer Bianca Bosker on this episode of Today, Explained. (It worked.)\n\nNoise has health implications, too. Everything from the music in spinning classes to the chatter in restaurants can take a toll on our bodies. Listen to this episode to learn more about how noise impacts your everyday life.\nBecause podcast\n\nThe Ezra Klein Show | Gretchen McCulloch is a self-described \u201Cinternet linguist,\u201D host of the podcast Lingthusiasm, and author of the recent book Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language. In it, she demonstrates that the way we\u2019ve come to speak on the internet \u2014 from emojis to exclamation points \u2014 is not random or arbitrary, but part of a broader attempt to make our written communication more vibrant, meaningful, and, genuinely human. Far from \u2018ruining\u2019 the written English language, internet-speak, McCulloch argues, is revolutionizing language in unprecedented, and ultimately positive, ways.\nHow streaming changed the sound of pop\n\nSwitched on Pop | Streaming hasn\u2019t just changed the way we listen to music; it\u2019s changed the way that pop music sounds. With ad-supported and subscription based business models, streaming platforms have upended incentives so significantly that it can be heard in the songwriting. Songs are getting shorter, albums are getting longer, and there is an entirely new section of the song that draws from the classical past: the \u201Cpop overture.\u201D In this episode, Nate and Charlie are joined by Aisha Hassan and Dan Kopf to unpack the sound of pop in the streaming era.\n\nHow to broadcast live TV from the moon ... in 1969\n\nPrimetime | Robert Stone directed the new PBS series \u201CChasing the Moon.\u201D It\u2019s chock full of new archival footage from the Space Race time period. And behind all that footage \u2014 some fascinating stories. Stone and Emily VanDerWerff discuss what\u2019s behind the conspiracy theories that the moon landing was fake.\nThe Airbnb scam\n\nReset | While on vacation in September 2019, reporter Allie Conti accidentally uncovered an elaborate Airbnb con, when she herself became the unwitting victim of the scam. When Conti researched her horrible host, she found that the same people responsible for scamming her also managed Airbnb listings in eight cities across the US. Listen to her full story, and learn how to protect yourself.\nHomelessness and how to fix it\n\nThe Weeds | Mary Cunningham, vice president of Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy at the Urban Institute, joins Matt Yglesias to discuss the causes and potential solutions of homelessness. They dive deep into the data surrounding the issue, and take a look at President Trump\u2019s claim that homelessness is on the rise.\n\nSafe travels this Thanksgiving holiday!\n"

    "text": "Updated at 7:50 p.m.: Revised to include new information throughout\n\nAUSTIN -- In a bizarre political blunder, a document laying out the Republican Party of Texas\u2019s election strategy for the 2020 elections has ended up in the hands of Texas Democrats. Attacking Democratic candidates through websites and mitigating \u201Cthe polarizing nature\u201D of President Donald Trump are part of the plan.\n\nThe document \u2014 called a draft for initial discussion by the Texas GOP Party chair \u2014 was titled \u201CPrimary/General Election 2020 [Draft]\u201D and began showing up in Democratic emails Monday evening.\nADVERTISING\n\nIt includes a target list of 12 statehouse districts, including six in North Texas, that Republicans are aiming to take back in next year\u2019s elections. Negative attacks through websites, and highlighting diverse Republicans to counter a \u201Cnarrative driven by Democrats\u201D about the GOP\u2019s lack of diversity are also part of the strategy.\n\nRepublican targets in North Texas are Dallas County Democratic Reps. Ana-Maria Ramos, Terry Meza, Rhetta Bowers, John Turner and Julie Johnson, as well as Denton County Rep. Michelle Beckley.\n\n\u201CStarting after the Primary, the RPT will generate microsites for negative hits against the Democrat candidates in our twelve target race\u2014we expect each microsite to be roughly $500,\u201D the document reads. \u201CWe will then begin rolling out these websites, prioritizing the races that were within 4% in the 2018 election.\u201D\n\nDemocrats are trying to take the majority in the Texas House for the first time since 2003. After gaining 12 seats in 2018, the Democrats narrowed the gap in the House to 67-83. And they have made no secret of their desire to win the majority next year.\n\n\u201CRepublicans have already fumbled the ball and we aren\u2019t even in 2020 yet,\" said Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. \u201CThey know they\u2019re in deep trouble \u2018given the polarizing nature of the President\u2019 and expect \u2018Republicans will refuse to turnout during the General Election because they don\u2019t want to vote for him.\u2019 The Texas Republican Party is desperate.\n\n\u201CTexas is the biggest battleground state and Texas Democrats are poised to win in 2020,\" he said.\n\nTexas GOP chair James Dickey said Monday night that a staffer \u201Ddrafted some initial thoughts for discussion. He said that \u201Cit should not be news\u201C that Republicans want to to take back the seats they lost in 2018.\nADVERTISING\n\n\u201DWe are doing that so we continue to dominate in 2020 just like we have for 25 years in Texas,\u201D he said.\nPoints in the plan\n\nMany of the strategies in the plan, like identifying targets and setting up negative attack websites, are not uncommon in politics. But their public disclosure \u2014 especially if that disclosure is unwanted or embarrassing \u2014 and the level of detail that became public is unusual.\n\nThe document lays out a plan to purchase online domain names affiliated with the names of Democratic candidates so that Republicans can reroute them to the negative attack websites.\n\n\u201CFor example, we will purchase ZwienerforTexas.com, ZwienerforTX.com, and so on,\u201D the document reads.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Erin Zwiener of Driftwood is among the other six House members on the list. The others are Reps. Vikki Goodwin and John Bucy of Austin, James Talarico of Round Rock, Gina Calanni of Katy and Jon Rosenthal of Houston.\n\nThe document says Republicans will audit search engine optimization results to make sure that the negative attack websites are on the front pages of various search engines and work with other stakeholders \u2014 such as Texans for Greg Abbott, the governor\u2019s campaign arm \u2014 \u201Cto get any more insight on issues that matter to these districts.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe will attack these Democrat candidates with contrast hits which we will obtain from, public votes from the 86th Legislative Session, their campaign websites, and any other means to gather negative material on them,\u201D the document says.\n\nIn addition to the individual websites, the plan calls for a \u201Cmaster site\" to house attacks on Democrats across the state, focusing on federal, state and down-ballot Democrats and \u201Chow Democrat values don\u2019t match Texas values.\u201D The master site would be used to fact-check political talking points and for rapid response efforts when national Democrats come to Texas, the document reads.\n\n\u201CThis site will generally serve as a vehicle the RPT can use to attack Democrats,\u201D the document reads.\nConcern about Trump\n\nThe plan also addresses a nagging concern for the Texas GOP: Trump\u2019s unpopularity with some Republicans in the state.\n\n\u201CGiven the polarizing nature of the President, I suspect some Republicans will refuse to turnout during the General Election because they don\u2019t want to vote for him - though I don\u2019t know that we will know what this universe would look like without us or a stakeholder creating a model,\u201D the document reads. \u201CRegardless, I suggest we set up a contingency budget to target these folks with mailers, digital ads, and texts to encourage them to turnout for U.S. Senate, State Senate, State House, and so on.\u201D\n\nIt is unclear who the \"I\" in the document refers to.\n\nThe plan also identifies the Republican-led elimination of straight ticket voting as \u201Cone of the biggest challenges ahead of the 2020 cycle.\u201D To address that, the plan details an effort to convince Republican voters to vote for GOP candidates all the way down the ballot manually through a tagline. Some of the potential taglines include: \u201CVote Right All the Way Down!\u201D \u201CVote Right To The Bottom!\u201D and \u201CVote RIGHT Down the Ballot!\u201D\n\nJames Barrag\u00E1n.

    "text": "Durham Probe\nPublished 1 day ago\nFISA report drop could scramble Trump impeachment effort\nBrooke Singman\nBy Brooke Singman | Fox News\n\n    Facebook\n    Twitter\n    Flipboard\n    Comments\n    Print\n    Email\n\nHorowitz report on FISA abuses to have limited redactions\n\nHorowitz's report nearing completion.\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz plans to drop his long-awaited report on FBI surveillance during the 2016 campaign just as House Democrats are moving toward likely articles of impeachment.\n\nFor allies of President Trump, the timing could be perfect.\n\nNo matter how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act review judges the actions of law enforcement with regard to Trump campaign associate surveillance, the report will give Trump the opportunity to shift focus once more to the Russia \"witch hunt\" -- and, as he has before, attempt to link that to Democrats' escalating impeachment inquiry over his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHOROWITZ REPORTEDLY FINDS FBI LAWYER FALSIFIED FISA DOC\n\n\u201CWhat they have coming out is historic,\u201D Trump himself teased last week, in an interview with \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nPreviewing his rhetorical line of attack, he said: \u201CThis was spying on my campaign. ... This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.\u201D\n\nAs he's already telegraphing, Trump is poised to argue anew that he has been the victim of unfair investigations since he was a candidate for president -- and allies say he'll be able to hammer home those claims, at a time when he'll need to keep any wavering Republicans by his side should impeachment head to the Senate for trial.\n\nHorowitz has been investigating alleged FISA abuses related to the Justice Department and FBI's surveillance of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign for more than a year and a half. The report, which is said to have few redactions, is expected to be made public on Dec. 9.\n\n    'This was spying on my campaign. ... This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.'\n    \u2014 President Trump\n\nOne House Republican source involved in impeachment proceedings told Fox News on Monday that the president is likely to seize on the findings to argue to lawmakers and the public that he has been unfairly targeted.\n\n\u201CIt will be damning evidence that government officials really were trying to sabotage Trump, which is what he\u2019s been saying all along, including during the impeachment debate,\u201D the source told Fox News.\n\nThe individual added: \u201CIt\u2019ll make it easy for Trump to portray impeachment as yet another political hit job by the Resistance meant to undermine him and oust him\u2014which of course it is.\u201D\n\nLast week, multiple news reports said that Horowitz had found evidence that an FBI lawyer manipulated a key investigative document related to the FBI\u2019s secretive surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. In its initial 2016 FISA warrant application, the FBI described Page as an \u201Cagent of a foreign power.\u201D\n\nHorowitz, in the course of his review, found that the FBI employee who allegedly manipulated the document falsely stated that he had \u201Cdocumentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis\u201D for the FISA warrant application, according to a report by The Washington Post. Then, the FBI employee allegedly \u201Caltered an email\u201D to substantiate his inaccurate version of events. The employee has since been forced out of the bureau.\n\nAt the same time, the Post reported that the alleged conduct did not affect an underlying finding that the surveillance application for Page \"had a proper legal and factual basis.\"\n\nThe details suggest the report could present a mixed picture -- a document members of both parties will likely mine for information favorable to their argument.\n\nFormer Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos -- who believes he, separately, was surveilled during the 2016 election through human sources while doing work overseas -- said the leaks surrounding the report were meant to reflect favorably upon law enforcement but warned there is likely damaging information forthcoming.\nPapadopoulos: IG report won\u2019t be pleasant for FBIVideo\n\n\u201CI think these leaks were incredibly timed,\u201D Papadopoulos said on \u201CFox & Friends\u201D Monday. \u201CI think the report is not going to be as pleasant as many think it\u2019s going to be for the FBI. And it\u2019s actually probably going to lead into criminal prosecutions that [prosecutor John] Durham is going to end up taking over for.\u201D\n\nHorowitz is expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 11, another event that will keep the FISA matter in the headlines. Horowitz has said that his final report would be released publicly, with few redactions, and noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue \u201Cseparate classified and public versions of the report.\u201D\n\nHorowitz's report could even spark new congressional investigations while offering information to other federal reviews probing allegations of abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI, giving Republicans yet another chance to turn the tables on Democrats amid the impeachment probe -- something they've already sought to do by focusing on allegations against the Bidens, as opposed to the allegations Trump wrongly pressured Ukraine to investigate the same issue.\n\nThe Justice Department and the FBI obtained warrants in 2016 to monitor Page. Page told Fox News earlier this month he was \"frustrated\" he had not been interviewed in Horowitz's probe.\n\nAccording to a House GOP memo released in 2018, the unverified anti-Trump dossier \u201Cformed an essential part\u201D of the approval of the warrant. The dossier was authored and compiled by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and was created on behalf of Fusion GPS\u2014the firm that was hired to conduct opposition research funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie.\n\nAdditionally, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was unable to substantiate key claims in the dossier, including that the Trump campaign employed hackers in the United States, that there was a compromising recording of the president in a hotel room, and that ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen flew to Prague to build a conspiracy with hackers. Cohen has denied ever heading to Prague, and no public evidence has contradicted that claim.\n\nMeanwhile, sources told Fox News last month that U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s separate, ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation\u2014and that Horowitz\u2019s report will shed light on why Durham\u2019s probe has become a criminal inquiry.\n\nIN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, SENATE REPUBLICANS COULD TURN TABLES ON DEMS\n\nDurham has reportedly taken up Horowitz\u2019s findings concerning the falsified FISA document, meaning the ex-FBI lawyer who made the changes is now under criminal investigation.\n\nThe FISA report comes after a packed spree of impeachment hearings led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. He announced a report is now being prepared for the Judiciary Committee, signaling that his panel is wrapping up its work. That committee could eventually draft articles of impeachment for a floor vote; if approved, the debate would shift to the Senate.\n\nThere, Trump\u2019s allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats.\n\nGraham penned a letter last week to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between former Vice President Joe Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThis pertains to questions surrounding the elder Biden\u2019s role in pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board. Biden denies any wrongdoing, but Republicans have pressed for details throughout the impeachment process, in a bid to show that even though Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Kiev triggered the impeachment inquiry, his concern was legitimate.\n\nAt the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump challenged the accuracy of the complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.\n\nThe president\u2019s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report. \nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News. Follow her on Twitter at @brookefoxnews."

    "text": "Cops have long had dogs, and robots, to help them do their jobs. And now, they have a robot dog.\n\nMassachusetts State Police is the first law enforcement agency in the country to use Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot, called Spot. While the use of robotic technology is not new for state police, the temporary acquisition of Spot \u2014 a customizable robot some have called \u201Cterrifying\u201D \u2014 is raising questions from civil rights advocates about how much oversight there should be over police robotics programs.\n\nGet up to speed on the news Boston is talking about by adding our daily newsletter to your morning routine. Sign up now.\n\nThe state\u2019s bomb squad had Spot on loan from the Waltham-based Boston Dynamics for three months starting in August until November, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and reviewed by WBUR.\n\nThe documents do not reveal a lot of details on the robot dog\u2019s exact use, but a state police spokesman said Spot, like the department\u2019s other robots, was used as a \u201Cmobile remote observation device\u201D to provide troopers with images of suspicious devices or potentially hazardous locations, like where an armed suspect might be hiding.\n\n\u201CRobot technology is a valuable tool for law enforcement because of its ability to provide situational awareness of potentially dangerous environments,\u201D state police spokesman David Procopio wrote.\n\nState police say Spot was used in two incidents, in addition to testing.\n\nBoston Dynamics vice president for business development Michael Perry said the company wants Spot to have lots of different uses, in industries ranging from oil and gas companies, to construction, to entertainment. He envisions police sending Spot into areas that are too hazardous for a human \u2014 a chemical spill, or near a suspected bomb, or into a hostage situation.\n\n\u201CRight now, our primary interest is sending the robot into situations where you want to collect information in an environment where it's too dangerous to send a person, but not actually physically interacting with the space,\u201D Perry said.\n\nSpot is a \u201Cgeneral purpose\u201D robot, with an open API. That means customers \u2014 whether a police department or warehouse operator \u2014 can customize Spot with its own software. (State police say they didn't use this feature.) It has a 360-degree, low-light camera, and an arm.\n\nFor all of its potential, Boston Dynamics doesn\u2019t want Spot weaponized. Perry said the lease agreements have a clause requiring the robot not be used in a way that would \u201Cphysically harm or intimidate people.\u201D\n\n\u201CPart of our early evaluation process with customers is making sure that we're on the same page for the usage of the robot,\u201D he said. \u201CSo upfront, we're very clear with our customers that we don't want the robot being used in a way that can physically harm somebody.\u201D\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why the company is opting for lease agreements, rather than a sale, Perry said. Boston Dynamics wants to be selective in which companies get access to Spot \u2014 and have the ability to take the equipment back if the lease is violated.\n\nWorries About Weaponized Robots\n\nThrough Procopio, state police said the department never weaponized any of its robots, including Spot.\n\nBut while Spot and other tactical robots aren\u2019t designed to kill, they still can. In 2016, Dallas Police sent a bomb disposal robot armed with explosives to kill a sniper who had shot at police officers and killed five. Experts said it was the first time a non-military robot had been used to intentionally kill a person.\n\nThat deadly potential, and lack of transparency about the state police\u2019s overall robotics program, worries Kade Crockford, director of the technology for liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. Crockford said they want to see a policy from state police about its use of robotics and a conversation about how and when robots should be used. State police didn\u2019t say whether there\u2019s a current policy about the use of robots, and the ACLU\u2019s records request to the agency didn\u2019t turn one up.\n\n\u201CWe just really don't know enough about how the state police are using this,\u201D Crockford said. \u201CAnd the technology that can be used in concert with a robotic system like this is almost limitless in terms of what kinds of surveillance and potentially even weaponization operations may be allowed.\u201D\n\n    \u201CWe just really don't know enough about how the state police are using this.\" Kade Crockford\n\nBeyond an agency policy, the ACLU is urging state and local lawmakers to enact laws or regulations at the state level to govern how increasingly advanced robots can be used. Nothing like that exists in Massachusetts now.\n\n\u201CWe really need some law and some regulation to establish a floor of protection to ensure that these systems can't be misused or abused in the government's hands,\u201D Crockford said. \u201CAnd no, a terms of service agreement is just insufficient.\u201D\n\nOthers, like Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law who specializes in robotics and cyberlaw, agree that police agencies like state police need to put more thought into how robots are used and publicize that plan. They\u2019re not equipment people are familiar with, like a car.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s enough of a visceral reaction to the use of robotics that the smart thing to do is come up with a policy,\u201D he said. \u201CHow is this going to be used? And compare the actual use to the stated policy. And they can weigh whether those uses are appropriate.\u201D\n\nThor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a former SWAT commander in Colorado, reiterated that, in most cases, robots are used in critical incidents \u2014 barricaded suspects, hostage situations or active assailants \u2014 not routine surveillance.\n\n\u201CNormally, when these types of tools are being deployed, it's pretty risky operation,\u201D he said.\n\nEells said he recognizes the need for more information about how these robots are used and the concern about how they might infringe on people\u2019s privacy or civil liberties. But he contended that police have to reach the same legal bar for, say, sending a robot into someone\u2019s house. They would need a warrant.\n\n    \u201CNormally, when these types of tools are being deployed, it's pretty risky operation.\u201D Thor Eells\n\n\u201CThose protections still exist,\u201D he said. \u201CThey're not something that can be circumnavigated by the utilization of robotics. Law enforcement still has a responsibility to ensure that they're used legally as deemed so by the courts.\u201D\n\nSometimes, though, technology used by police outpaces the law \u2014 like GPS tracking. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled police couldn't place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car without a warrant. The court ruled again for privacy in 2015, declaring that police must get a search warrant to access someone's cellphone location information.\n\nEells believes there\u2019s a way to balance the community\u2019s right to know about police tools used by law enforcement, and any necessary secrecy about specific tactics.\n\nThe Future Of Robotic Law Enforcement Is Already Here\n\nOther than Spot, state police has a permanent fleet of robots. As of 2017, the bomb squad had 18 robotic platforms worth $1.8 million that are used on a weekly basis, according to police records. Most of those are tracked robots, not a legged robot like Spot.\n\nBut there\u2019s something different about Spot. Calo, the professor, acknowledged there\u2019s not a big operational difference between the robot dog and something like a more typically robot-looking PackBot. But, he said, Spot feels different. He pointed to a statement animal-rights group PETA put out, saying that it\u2019s not cruel to kick Spot, because it\u2019s not a real dog.\nRobots and police departments are no strangers.

In this photo, a member of the Cambridge police bomb squad used a robot during a search for the Boston Marathon bombings suspect in 2013. (Michael Dwyer/AP)\n\nRobots in general fall in an area between machine and person, Calo said, even for robots like Spot, that are remote-controlled.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s a social valiance of robots that affects our perceptions of them, and these are particularly evocative robots,\u201D he said.\n\nAnd there\u2019s something about Spot that even excited state police troopers.\n\nIn one email in June, a lieutenant on the special tactical operations team wrote to a colleague, \u201CDude, it\u2019s time,\u201D with a link to a New York Post article headlined, \u201CBoston Dynamics\u2019 creepy dog-like robot is about to go on sale.\u201D\n\nIn a different email in\n\nMay, other troopers shared a YouTube video of Spot dancing to Bruno Mars and navigating a construction site.\n\nA few months later, the troopers were behind the remote, using Spot in the field.\n\nThis program aired on November 25, 2019.\nRelated:\n\n    Robots Won't Take Away All Our Jobs, MIT Report Finds\n    Cleanup On Aisle 9: Robots Arrive At Grocery Stores Near You\n    How A Robot Is Changing Furniture Making At A Factory In Fitchburg\n    Does This Robot Freak You Out?\n\nAlly Jarmanning\n\nDigital Producer\nAlly is a reporter who champions data and public records in the WBUR newsroom.\n\nMore\u2026\n375Join the discussion\n"

    "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s top Europe envoy Gordon Sondland told House impeachment investigators Wednesday that Trump conditioned a valuable White House meeting for Ukraine's new president on his willingness to launch investigations into Trump\u2019s Democratic adversaries, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201CWas there a \u2018quid pro quo?\u2019\u201D Sondland \u2014 a close Trump ally and longtime GOP donor \u2014 said in his opening remarks to the House Intelligence Committee. \u201CThe answer is yes.\u201D\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSondland's testimony, the most explosive to date in a series of public impeachment hearings, portrayed Trump as the driver of an effort to pressure a foreign power to investigate his political rivals. Democrats quickly seized on the bombshell testimony as they seek to make the case that Trump abused his power by conditioning official acts to benefit his re-election campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\nSondland: 'Was there a quid pro quo? The answer is yes.'\n\nBut it went further than that, according to Sondland, who said the scheme was widely known, understood and discussed at the highest levels of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201CEveryone was in the loop. It was no secret,\u201D said the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, adding that he directly communicated the \u201Cquid pro quo\u201D to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSondland claimed that senior officials including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and even cabinet secretaries were aware of the arrangement \u2014 and that it was carried out at the \u201Cexpress direction\u201D of the president. Sondland specifically cited a July 19 email copied to Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and \u201Ca lot of senior officials.\u201D In that email, Sondland reveals that he \u201Cjust talked to Zelensky\u201D and secured a commitment for a \u201Cfully transparent investigation.\u201D\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump on Wednesday quickly distanced himself from his ambassador. \u201CI don't know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well,\u201D the president told reporters at the White House.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Sondland\u2019s testimony was \u201Crelated to his presumptions and beliefs, rather than hard facts,\u201D and slammed Democrats for relying on \u201Cunreliable and indirect evidence.\u201D\nTrump distances himself from Sondland: 'Not a man I know well'\n\nDuring the hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, walked Sondland through a chronology intended to make the case that Trump conditioned \u201Cofficial acts\u201D \u2014 a White House meeting and nearly $400 million of military aid \u2014 on receiving a \u201Cthing of value,\u201D his favored investigations. Schiff\u2019s questioning was a nod to the language of federal bribery statutes.\n\nSchiff said Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201Cgoes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201D adding: \u201CThe veneer has been torn away.\u201D\n\nRepublican lawmakers portrayed Sondland as an unreliable witness.\n\nUnder questioning from GOP counsel Steve Castor \u2014 who called Sondland a \u201Ctrifecta of unreliability\u201D \u2014 Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump about any pre-conditions for the military aid or the White House meeting. Republicans also sought to highlight Sondland\u2019s claim that it was only his \u201Cpresumption\u201D that the military aid was part of a quid pro quo, and that he did not take contemporaneous notes.\n\n\u201CPresident Trump never told me directly that the aid was tied to that statement\u201D about investigations, Sondland said.\n\nIn his opening statement, Sondland injected a new wrinkle into the quid pro quo claim: that Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky itself was the product of a quid pro quo for investigations. On that day, Trump spoke directly to Zelensky and referenced his request for a Biden investigation during the phone call, which has become the central focus of the impeachment inquiry.\nMOST READ\nDonald Trump\n\n    Trump heads where everybody loves him \u2014 and hates impeachment\n    Dems move rapidly on impeachment with first Judiciary Committee hearing\n    Oversight panel sues William Barr, Wilbur Ross over 2020 census documents\n    Here's why Bloomberg insists he's not crazy\n    DNC vice chair tussles with Fox anchor over Tucker Carlson\n\nIMPEACHMENT TODAY\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will hold its first hearing next week on Wednesday as Democrats move quickly to the next stage of the impeachment process.\nRight now, impeachment is all about Ukraine.

    "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson is a propagandist, though a clever and savvy one. And on his program Monday night, he was up to the usual routine of discrediting the entire Democratic presidential field \u2014 talking up their divisions and reaching far to fetch a solution. Michelle Obama, he said, was \u201Cone of the only people who could unite the party\u2019s warring factions.\u201D\n\nOn the morning program \u201CAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201D host Bill Hemmer used Carlson\u2019s comments to introduce a chat with Michael Blake, a New York state assemblyman and a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. \u201CWhat do you think about the prediction on Michelle Obama?\u201D Hemmer asked. \u201CWould you like to see that?\u201D\n\nIt was a curious way to premise a conversation on the Democratic presidential race, as Blake noted in his response. \u201CWell, she\u2019s not running,\u201D Blake stated right off the bat.\nAD\nADVERTISING\n\nThen came the haymakers: \u201CBut the core question is why in hell does Tucker Carlson still have a job here in the first place. The reality is this is someone who said white supremacy is a hoax and why does Fox allow him to still be here in the first place?\u201D\n\nSign up to receive Opinions columns like these in your inbox six days a week\n\nPhenomenal question! Over the summer Carlson did indeed aver that white nationalism is a hoax \u2014 a false claim of the gaslighting variety. In truth, white nationalism is alive and, unfortunately, thriving. It even has a champion in the White House. Another point Blake might have noted is that Carlson has accused Democrats of hating their own country, even though Carlson remains a registered Democrat.\n\nIt will not surprise die-hard Fox News viewers that the smooth Hemmer managed his way out of this live on-air bind with aplomb. Here\u2019s how he and Blake socked it out:\nAD\n\n    Hemmer: Well, I mean, his opinion there was that Michelle Obama may get in this race. Do you think that will happen or do you not?\n    Blake: Not going to happen but I think the core question is he shouldn\u2019t be on here at all.\n    Hemmer: I got it. We didn\u2019t bring you on to talk about Tucker Carlson. I brought you on here to talk about the Democratic field.\n\nBlake, though, wasn\u2019t content with just a single jab at Fox News on Fox News. He kept at it. As Blake gave his broad view of contemporary politics, he couldn\u2019t help but include mention of the network on which he was unfurling his analysis. \u201CPeople are sick and tired of the noise out of D.C.,\u201D said Blake. \u201CWe\u2019re talking about jobs while [President] Trump is ignoring the truth. We\u2019re talking about health care while he\u2019s ignoring the truth and the question must be for Donald Trump, for Fox News and for other entities,\u201D said Blake, in a fit of on-the-mark wisdom.\n\nHemmer barged in: \u201CListen, I didn\u2019t bring you on to bash our network, so with all due respect, why don\u2019t we just keep it on topic.\u201D\n\nBlake rebutted: \u201CBut it\u2019s relevant.\u201D\n\nHemmer: \u201CNo, it\u2019s not.\u201D\n\nBlake: \u201CWell, the Tucker Carlson premise.\u201D\n\nHemmer: \u201CIt is not relevant to the conversation we\u2019re having. Save it for later.\u201D\nAD\n\nWith that, Hemmer undercut his own credibility as a host on the supposedly \u201Cstraight news\u201D side of Fox News. When it comes to the ongoing presidential race, Fox News is absolutely \u201Crelevant.\u201D Its opinion hosts \u2014 chiefly Carlson and Sean Hannity, two of the most powerful people in the U.S. United States today \u2014 either set or regurgitate talking points for Trump and his lackeys in Congress. It discredits truth-telling mainstream media outlets when they report negative things about Trump and hails them when they report negative things about Democrats. Its viewers regard those opinion hosts as cultural heroes and flawless truth-tellers. It provides a farm system for Trump administration recruits.\n\nAll of this is out there in plain sight. Fox News is such a powerful component of contemporary politics that any straightforward analysis of the presidential contest must include mention of the network. That Blake did it with such detachment and matter-of-fact delivery slammed the point home.\n\nFox News likes to say that its news division \u2014 home to Hemmer, Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum and others \u2014 and its opinion people \u2014 Carlson, Hannity, \u201CFox & Friends\u201D and others \u2014 are separate entities. If so, why would Hemmer use a comment from Carlson to kick off a segment on the supposedly straight news program \u201CAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201D? The thing is, Fox News has a history of doing just that \u2014 taking clips from Hannity or former host Bill O\u2019Reilly or Carlson and using them to launch segments. Hemmer & Co. beware: There is great risk in this juxtaposition.\nAD\n\nAnd, more importantly, there is no substantive rebuttal to Blake\u2019s objections. Hemmer did his best to steer clear of the force field created by the corruption of his own employer, insisting that Fox News was irrelevant to the discussion. But he didn\u2019t venture a defense of Carlson because there is no defense of Carlson.\n\nAs to Blake\u2019s question of why Carlson remains in the employ of Fox News, there\u2019s a twofold answer: One, because he gets good ratings. Two, because his divisive style has won the support of his bosses, the Murdochs. Which is to say, he has a job because he says things like white nationalism is a hoax, not despite them."

    "text": "Global Storms on Mars Launch Dust Towers Into the Sky\nSide-by-side movies shows how the 2018 global dust storm enveloped the Red Planet, courtesy of the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) camera onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). This global dust storm caused NASA's Opportunity rover to lose contact with Earth. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\u203A Full image and caption\n\nDust storms are common on Mars. But every decade or so, something unpredictable happens: A series of runaway storms breaks out, covering the entire planet in a dusty haze.\n\nLast year, a fleet of NASA spacecraft got a detailed look at the life cycle of the 2018 global dust storm that ended the Opportunity rover's mission. And while scientists are still puzzling over the data, two papers recently shed new light on a phenomenon observed within the storm: dust towers, or concentrated clouds of dust that warm in sunlight and rise high into the air. Scientists think that dust-trapped water vapor may be riding them like an elevator to space, where solar radiation breaks apart their molecules. This might help explain how Mars' water disappeared over billions of years.\n\nDust towers are massive, churning clouds that are denser and climb much higher than the normal background dust in the thin Martian atmosphere. While they also occur under normal conditions, the towers appear to form in greater numbers during global storms.\n\nA tower starts at the planet's surface as an area of rapidly lifted dust about as wide as the state of Rhode Island. By the time a tower reaches a height of 50 miles (80 kilometers), as seen during the 2018 global dust storm, it may be as wide as Nevada. As the tower decays, it can form a layer of dust 35 miles (56 kilometers) above the surface that can be wider than the continental United States.\n\nThe recent findings on dust towers come courtesy of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which is led by the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Though global dust storms cloak the planet's surface, MRO can use its heat-sensing Mars Climate Sounder instrument to peer through the haze. The instrument is designed specifically for measuring dust levels. Its data, coupled with images from a camera aboard the orbiter called the Mars Context Imager (MARCI), enabled scientists to detect numerous swelling dust towers.\n\nHow Did Mars Lose Its Water?\n\nDust towers appear throughout the Martian year, but MRO observed something different during the 2018 global dust storm. \"Normally the dust would fall down in a day or so,\" said the paper's lead author, Nicholas Heavens of Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. \"But during a global storm, dust towers are renewed continuously for weeks.\" In some cases, multiple towers were seen for as long as 3 1/2 weeks.\n\nThe rate of dust activity surprised Heavens and other scientists. But especially intriguing is the possibility that dust towers act as \"space elevators\" for other material, transporting them through the atmosphere. When airborne dust heats up, it creates updrafts that carry gases along with it, including the small quantity of water vapor sometimes seen as wispy clouds on Mars.\n\nA previous paper led by Heavens showed that during a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, water molecules were lofted into the upper atmosphere, where solar radiation could break them down into particles that escape into space. That might be a clue to how the Red Planet lost its lakes and rivers over billions of years, becoming the freezing desert it is today.\n\nScientists can't say with certainty what causes global dust storms; they've studied fewer than a dozen to date.\n\n\"Global dust storms are really unusual,\" said Mars Climate Sounder scientist David Kass of JPL. \"We really don't have anything like this on the Earth, where the entire planet's weather changes for several months.\"\n\nWith time and more data, the MRO team hopes to better understand the dust towers created within global storms and what role they may play in removing water from the Red Planet's atmosphere.\n\nFor more information about MRO:\n\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/mro/\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html\n\nNews Media Contact\nAndrew Good\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n818-393-2433\nandrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nAlana Johnson\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1501\nalana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\n"

    "text": "(CNN)Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time.\nBiden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%.\nNo other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.\n\nThe findings suggest slight declines in support for Biden and Warren since October, and a modest increase in backing for Buttigieg. Sanders' support remains about the same as it was in October.\nA majority of potential Democratic voters remain uncertain about their choices. Just 42% say they have definitely decided on their candidates, about the same as in October, and Biden continues to have an edge among that group of committed voters.\nAsked who they would choose if the race came down to the top four instead of the 18 major candidates currently in the running, the order at the top remains the same. Biden continues to hold a lead -- 35% say they would choose him -- with 23% choosing Sanders, 20% Warren and 17% Buttigieg.\nButtigieg's bump in the poll coincides with a well-received debate performance, with 22% who watched or followed news coverage about last week's debate saying he had the best night. Biden lands in second at 16%, Sanders at 10%, Harris and Warren each at 8% and Booker at 5%.\nMost potential Democratic voters say they prefer a candidate who aims for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if they wouldn't make major changes, over a candidate who aims for policies that would make larger changes (56% feel that way, 36% prefer a candidate who shoots for major change). But when asked which candidate would best handle specific issues, potential Democratic voters are more closely divided between those seeking big changes and those aiming for more incremental progress.\nOn health care, 28% say Sanders -- an advocate of \"Medicare for All\" and the elimination of private health insurance -- would best handle the issue. That's about even with the 26% who choose Biden, who has argued against moving to a completely government-run system. Another 19% say they prefer Warren's approach, which ultimately results in government health coverage for all, while 7% choose Buttigieg, and no other candidate has the backing of more than 3% on the issue.\nSanders leads the way more clearly on handling the climate crisis: 27% favor his approach, followed by 21% who prefer Biden and 15% Warren.\nBiden holds an edge on the economy, though by a narrower margin than he did in October. About 3 in 10 (29%) prefer him on the issue, down from 38% last month, with Warren at 19% and Sanders at 17%. Buttigieg lands at 7% and Yang at 5% on the issue.\nBiden has lost some ground as most trusted on almost all the issues tested, while Buttigieg has made gains nearly across the board.\nMore potential Democratic voters see Biden as capable of managing the government effectively (86%) than say the same about Sanders (73%), Warren (73%) or Buttigieg (54%). Biden also tops the leading candidates on being able to unite the country rather than divide it (73% say so, vs. 65% for Sanders, 58% for Warren and 54% for Buttigieg).\nSanders (66%), Biden (64%) and Warren (61%) are all closely clustered on being able to bring needed change, with Buttigieg a bit behind at 54%.\nWarren holds a clear advantage on having the stamina and sharpness to be president -- 81% say that describes her, compared with 66% for Buttigieg, 65% for Biden and 58% for Sanders.\nSanders' strength is being seen as honest and trustworthy. Nearly 9 in 10 potential Democratic voters (89%) call Sanders honest and trustworthy, vs. 78% for Warren, 75% for Biden and 64% for Buttigieg. That carries through among all adults as well. Overall, 62% see Sanders as honest and trustworthy, making him the only candidate of the top four Democrats plus President Donald Trump who is seen that way by a majority of Americans.\nAll four tested Democratic candidates outpace Trump on two measures: honesty (62% Sanders, 49% Warren, 47% Biden, 45% Buttigieg, 36% Trump) and uniting the country rather than dividing it (47% Biden, 44% Sanders, 37% Warren, 35% Buttigieg, 31% Trump).\nTrump ties Sanders at the top on being able to bring needed change (43% each, followed by Biden at 40%, Warren at 39%, Buttigieg at 35%). Biden leads the field on managing the government effectively (55% Biden, 46% Sanders, 44% Warren, 42% Trump, 36% Buttigieg). While Warren takes the lead on having the stamina and sharpness for the presidency (54% describe Warren that way, 47% Trump, 46% Buttigieg, 44% Biden and 40% Sanders).\nOne caveat on these figures: A large number (roughly a quarter across attributes) say they are unsure how to answer about Buttigieg. For the other candidates, that number was in the single digits across the board.\n\nHealth care (46% extremely important) and gun policy (44% extremely important) continue to rank at the top of voters' issue concerns for 2020. The impeachment inquiry into Trump ranks near the bottom, with 27% calling that extremely important. That rises a bit to 39% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, but dips to just 15% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters.\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS November 21 through 24 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among the 431 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, it is plus or minus 5.7 percentage points.\n\n    Paid Content\n        Survive acid reflux this Thanksgiving (#5 is crucial) Survive acid reflux this Thanksgiving (#5 is crucial) Medcline\n        Know all the triggers of psoriatic arthritis.

    "text": "A former McDonald\'s employee says a male co-worker at a Michigan restaurant routinely grabbed her breasts and buttocks and propositioned her for sex — allegations laid out in a new class-action lawsuit that accuses McDonald\'s of a \"culture of sexual harassment.\"\n\nThe lawsuit against McDonald\'s and its Michigan franchise is the latest allegation of rampant abuse and harassment of female employees at the fast-food chain. Lawyers representing workers say more than 50 claims and charges of harassment of female employees are pending against McDonald\'s in courts and at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nTheir accusations drew new focus last week when McDonald\'s fired its CEO, Steve Easterbrook, over a consensual relationship with an employee. He is not accused of sexual harassment, but the relationship violated company policy. Still, Easterbrook is receiving a multi-million-dollar exit package.\nMcDonald\'s Fired CEO Is Getting Millions, Putting Spotlight On Pay Gap\nBusiness\nMcDonald\'s Fired CEO Is Getting Millions, Putting Spotlight On Pay Gap\n\nTuesday\'s lawsuit by former McDonald\'s employee Jenna Ries points to Easterbrook\'s firing to allege that McDonald\'s as a corporation \"creates and permits a toxic work culture from the very top.\"\n\nIn the lawsuit, Ries says a store manager repeatedly harassed her, called her names, pulled her hair, and at one point, when they were working next to each other in the kitchen, even \"placed his penis\" in her hand. According to the filing, Ries witnessed similar harassment of other women and girls, and reported the co-worker to the general manager — but the behavior continued.\n\nMore than 50 women who have worked at the Michigan franchise could join her class-action suit if it\'s recognized, according to the filing. The lawsuit seeks $5 million in damages for workers at the Mason, Mich., location.\n\nThe vast majority of McDonald\'s restaurants are owned by franchisees. But the lawsuit says the corporation, too, has failed to address the \"systemic sexual harassment\" and therefore enabled it.\nProtests Over Sexual Harassment At McDonald\'s Grow As Shareholders Meet\nBusiness\nProtests Over Sexual Harassment At McDonald\'s Grow As Shareholders Meet\n\n\"This is not just about me,\" Ries told reporters on Tuesday. \"This is about countless McDonald\'s workers around the country who have survived sexual harassment on the job. We deserve to feel safe at work.\"\n\nMcDonald\'s, in a statement, said it was \"demonstrating its continued commitment\" to the issue by adding a new anti-harassment training program to all corporate-owned restaurants. It also said it was \"encouraged\" by the progress getting franchisees to implement the training.\n\n\"There is a deeply important conversation around safe and respectful workplaces in communities throughout the U.S. and around the world, and McDonald\'s is demonstrating its continued commitment to this issue,\" McDonald\'s said in the statement.\nPost-#MeToo, Ernst & Young Grapples With Diverging Views Of Its Culture\nBusiness\nPost-#MeToo, Ernst & Young Grapples With Diverging Views Of Its Culture\n\nIn May, McDonald\'s workers across the U.S. staged protests against low pay and the company\'s handling of alleged sexual harassment. That\'s when workers filed numerous complaints against McDonald\'s, with the backing of the Time\'s Up Legal Defense Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union and the labor group Fight for $15.\n\nThe groups say they expected hundreds of workers in Michigan to join a new strike on Tuesday."

    "text": "Three women and six children died in an attack in northern Mexico earlier this month\n\nThe US will legally designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, President Donald Trump says.\n\nThe move would enable a wider scope of US action. Mr Trump also said he had told Mexico the US was ready to \"go in and clear out\" the cartels.\n\nIn response Mexico's foreign minister said his country would not allow any \"violation of national sovereignty\".\n\nEarlier this month Mr Trump vowed to \"wage war on the drug cartels\" after a deadly attack on US citizens in Mexico.\n\nThe victims - three women and six children who were Mormons of dual US-Mexican nationality - were killed in an ambush while travelling through a remote area of northern Mexico on 4 November.\n\n    How a US Mormon family ended up dead in Mexico\n    First funerals held for Mexico ambush victims\n    How dangerous is Mexico?\n\nOfficials said it may have been a case of mistaken identity, but relatives of the victims said the killers must have known whom they were targeting.\n\nAfter the attack the victims' community, the LeBarons, petitioned the White House to list the cartels as terror groups, saying: \"They are terrorists and it's time to acknowledge it.\"\nMedia captionPresident Trump tells Bill O'Reilly about his plan to designate cartels as terror groups\nWhat did Trump say?\n\nConservative media figure Bill O'Reilly asked President Trump on Tuesday whether he was going to designate the cartels as terror groups and \"start hitting them with drones\".\n\nThe president said: \"They will be designated... I have been working on that for the last 90 days. You know, designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process.\"\n\nHe added that he had told Mexican President Andr\u00E9s Manuel L\u00F3pez Obrador that the US was willing to launch operations against the cartels inside Mexico.\n\n\"I've already offered him to let us go in and clean it out and he so far has rejected the offer but at some point something has to be done,\" Mr Trump said.\nWhat would the designation mean?\n\nWhen a group is designated as a terrorist organisation in the US, it becomes illegal for people in the US to knowingly offer support.\n\nIts members are also banned from entering the US. If they are already in the US, they face being deported.\n\n    Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels\n    'I spent eight months working for a drug cartel'\n    Drug lord 'El Chapo' found guilty in US\n\nIf financial institutions discover they have funds connected to the group, they are required to block the money and alert the US Treasury Department.\n\nSome analysts suggest that the designation could affect the supply of weapons to the cartels from the US.\nMedia captionThree ways the US is influencing violence in Mexico\n\nEarlier this year a US government study traced more than 150,000 firearms including assault rifles back from Mexican criminals to gun shops and factories in the US.\n\nUnder anti-terror laws, those who purchase the guns in the US for the cartels could face much heavier penalties.\n\nOther analysts suggest such a designation could complicate possible Mexican government negotiations with cartels as well as efforts by US agencies and NGOs to support peace moves.\nHow has Mexico responded?\n\nForeign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico had made clear to the US its rejection of any violation of its sovereignty. He also said Mexico was committed to tackling transnational organised crime.\n\n\"Mutual respect is the basis for cooperation,\" Mr Ebrard said.\n\nA foreign ministry statement said Mr Ebrard would discuss the issue with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nMedia captionIn October Sinaloa cartel gunmen overpowered Mexican security forces in the city of Culiac\u00E1n\n\nMexico wants measures to reduce the flow of weapons and money from the US to the cartels as well as efforts to stop the movement of drugs across its territory towards the US, the statement said.\n\nOn Monday Mr L\u00F3pez Obrador told journalists Mexico would not accept foreign intervention against the cartels.\n\n\"Our problems will be solved by Mexicans. We don't want any interference from any foreign country,\" he said.\nHow powerful are the cartels?\n\nMexico's brutal drug war claims tens of thousands of lives every year, as powerful trafficking groups battle for territory and influence. In 2017 more than 30,000 people were killed in the country, with the murder rate having more than tripled since 2006.\n\nThe cartels control vast areas and are also responsible for political corruption, assassinations and kidnappings.\n\nEarlier this week at least 13 police officers were killed in an ambush in the western state of Michoac\u00E1n. The attack is believed to have been carried out by the Jalisco New Generation cartel.\nMedia captionMexico's drug war: Has it turned the tide?\n\nIn a now-notorious incident in October, hundreds of gunmen from the Sinaloa cartel overpowered security forces in the Sinaloa state capital Culiac\u00E1n, taking troops hostage and eventually forcing the government to release a captured cartel leader Ovidio Guzm\u00E1n.\n\nPresident L\u00F3pez Obrador has opted for a non-confrontational approach to the cartels, instead making tackling inequality central to his efforts under a policy dubbed \"abrazos, no balazos\" - hugs not bullets.\n\nBut this policy has come in for criticism after Mexican security forces were so comprehensively outgunned in Culiac\u00E1n.\n\nThe US government has described the Sinaloa Cartel as one of the largest drug-trafficking organisations in the world.\n\nIn July its former leader Joaqu\u00EDn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00E1n was sentenced to life in prison following one of the most high-profile trials in recent US history. But the group continues to make billions of dollars from trafficking illicit narcotics to the US, Europe and Asia, experts say.\n\nMeanwhile the Jalisco cartel is believed to have assets worth more than $20bn (\u00A315.5bn) and is one of the main distributors of synthetic drugs on the continent, the US says.\n\nIt has gained notoriety for attacks on security forces and public officials, including the downing of an army helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade.\nRelated Topics\n\n    Mexico\n    Donald Trump\n    United States\n    Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\n    Mexico ambush\n\nShare this story About sharing\n\n    Email\n    Facebook\n    Messenger\n    Twitter\n    Pinterest\n    LinkedIn\n\nMore on this story\n\n    Mexico ambush: How a US Mormon family ended up dead\n    8 Novem\n\n    ber 2019\n    How dangerous is Mexico?\n    6 November 2019\n    Mexico ambush: Mormon families hold first funerals for victims\n    7 November 2019\n\nUS & Canada\nTrump invited to impeachment hearing\n\n    27 November 2019\n    From the section US & Canada \n\nFull article Trump invited to impeachment hearing\nVideo\nVideo\nTrump jokes about impeachment at turkey pardon\n\n    26 November 2019\n    From the section US & Canada \n\nFull article Trump jokes about impeachment at turkey pardon\nKidney transplant given to wrong patient in US\n\n    27 November 2019\n    From the section US & Canada \n\nFull article Kidney transplant given to wrong patient in US\nMore Videos from the BBC\n\nWildcats 'to return' after long absence\nI followed my father's advice and became a billionaire\n\n    'What a find!' - the treasure of the north coast \n\n"
